# Linked Lists Flight Manifests
An NNU data structures course project that required the creation of single and double-linked lists classes from scratch. 
The purpose of this project was to get familiarized with object-oriented programming (OOP) and related concepts, pointers, 
and the linked lists data structure. 

The outcome of this project was a fully functional flight manifest manager, where users can make or change reservations, print
out the passengers on the flight in alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order, and print out all of the flights as well as all
of the passengers on each flight. In order to create this console application, a singly linked list of flight nodes was used in which 
each flight node points to a doubly linked list of passenger nodes. Using both single and double-linked lists was a challenge when
first trying to understand the concept of linked lists but helped me grasp this concept and future data structures concepts better.
